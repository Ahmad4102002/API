2/11/2026 : I dont know what is going on in my life sometimes I feel extemely anxious and feel like my world is crashing down on me and then suddenly I am just calm and focused. Tomorrow I will complete the Jmeter Tutorial and start re
            revising some uestions. Later I will study about sockets and HTTP. 

2/12/2026 : Today was also very hard. My mental health is not okay, the stress of not being enough has started to take its toll on my mind. I dont know what lies in the future I just want to learn without peoples judgement.

2/14/2026 : I got my bike back. It is not as good as before but still i am happy i got it back.
